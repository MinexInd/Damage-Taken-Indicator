### ✨ Features
*   **100% Client-Side**: Works on any server without needing the mod installed on the server!
*   **Damage & Healing Indicators**: Clearly see how much damage you take (Red) and how much you heal (Green).
*   **Critical Hit Visuals**: Large, distinct indicators (Gold) for high-damage hits to help you prioritize threats.
*   **Damage Accumulation**: Rapid hits are summed up into a single total, perfect for tracking damage from fire, poison, or multiple mobs.
*   **Live-Reload Config**: Tweak colors, scale, and positions in real-time without ever restarting your game.
*   **Human-Readable Settings**: No messy hex codes! Use simple names like `RED`, `GOLD`, or `AQUA`.

*   **Colors**: Custom colors for damage, healing, and crits.
*   **Scaling**: Make indicators as large or small as you like.
*   **Positioning**: Offset the indicators to fit your custom UI.
